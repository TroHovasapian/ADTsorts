# ADTsorts
This program was the last project in my Abstract Data Types class. The goal was to create a program that generated a random unordered list and sorted it. 
I decided to implement Merge Sort and Insertion Sort, and compare them. In the file in which all my code is, I have also inserted a pdf of the report I
wrote about the program.

Thank you!

Instructions if you wanted to run the program:

Execute program using terminal on linux:

do "./generate"

input the amount of lines you want it to sort from 10-100,000

do "./mergesort" or "./insertionsort"

if you want to see the time of each sorting algorithm:

include "time"
